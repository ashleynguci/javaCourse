**#CompoundInterest**: Create a program called CompoundInterest to compute compound interest for the initial deposit in a savings account.
Assume that all the interest is left to balance the interest rate does not change after the initial deposit the capital income tax is subtracted from the interest before it is added to the balance.
First, the program inputs the initial deposit , interest rate (%), capital income tax rate (%) and the number of years. Then the program prints the balance of the account at the end of each year.

**#Factorial**: Create a program called Factorial that displays the factorial of the given non-negative integer. If the input value is invalid, the program should display "Please enter a non-negative integer."
The factorial n! is calculated as follows: 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x n. 
For example, 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24.
By definition, the factorial 0! is 1.

**#ValidateThird**: Create a program called ValidateThird that inputs a grade number (0-5) from the user. If the input is a valid grade number, the program should print "OK". Otherwise, the program should print the entered value and "is not a valid grade." and prompt a grade number again. The program should keep asking grade numbers until the user enters a valid grade number.

**#ValidateSecond:** Create a program called ValidateSecond that inputs a grade number (0-5) from the user. If the inputted value is not valid integer between 0 and 5, the program should print "Please enter an integer between 0 and 5." Otherwise, the program should print "OK".

**#ValidateFirst**:Create a program called ValidateFirst that inputs a grade number from the user. If the inputted value cannot be converted to an integer, the program should print "Please enter an integer." Otherwise, the program should print "OK".
**#PositiveOddInteger**: Create a program called PositiveOddIntegers that inputs values from the user until he/she decides to quit by entering the text "quit". The program should check if the inputted value is a positive odd integer. NB! Use the remainder operator in this exercise.
