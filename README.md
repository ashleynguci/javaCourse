#CompoundInterest: Create a program called CompoundInterest to compute compound interest for the initial deposit in a savings account.
Assume that all the interest is left to balance the interest rate does not change after the initial deposit the capital income tax is subtracted from the interest before it is added to the balance.
First, the program inputs the initial deposit , interest rate (%), capital income tax rate (%) and the number of years. Then the program prints the balance of the account at the end of each year.

#Factorial: Create a program called Factorial that displays the factorial of the given non-negative integer. If the input value is invalid, the program should display "Please enter a non-negative integer."
The factorial n! is calculated as follows: 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x n. 
For example, 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24.
By definition, the factorial 0! is 1.
