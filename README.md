**#CompoundInterest**: Create a program called CompoundInterest to compute compound interest for the initial deposit in a savings account.
Assume that all the interest is left to balance the interest rate does not change after the initial deposit the capital income tax is subtracted from the interest before it is added to the balance.
First, the program inputs the initial deposit , interest rate (%), capital income tax rate (%) and the number of years. Then the program prints the balance of the account at the end of each year.

**#Factorial**: Create a program called Factorial that displays the factorial of the given non-negative integer. If the input value is invalid, the program should display "Please enter a non-negative integer."
The factorial n! is calculated as follows: 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x n. 
For example, 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24.
By definition, the factorial 0! is 1.

**#ValidateThird**: Create a program called ValidateThird that inputs a grade number (0-5) from the user. If the input is a valid grade number, the program should print "OK". Otherwise, the program should print the entered value and "is not a valid grade." and prompt a grade number again. The program should keep asking grade numbers until the user enters a valid grade number.

**#ValidateSecond:** Create a program called ValidateSecond that inputs a grade number (0-5) from the user. If the inputted value is not valid integer between 0 and 5, the program should print "Please enter an integer between 0 and 5." Otherwise, the program should print "OK".

**#ValidateFirst**:Create a program called ValidateFirst that inputs a grade number from the user. If the inputted value cannot be converted to an integer, the program should print "Please enter an integer." Otherwise, the program should print "OK".

**#PositiveOddInteger**: Create a program called PositiveOddIntegers that inputs values from the user until he/she decides to quit by entering the text "quit". The program should check if the inputted value is a positive odd integer. NB! Use the remainder operator in this exercise.

**#Product of digits**
Create a program called ProductOfDigits that first inputs an integer from the user. Then the program computes and prints the product of the digits of the integer. Use the remainder operator in this exercise. Hint: In Java, 2019 / 10 is 201.

**#MethodsSecond**Create a program called MethodsSecond that has a method called printRectangle that prints a 'rectangle shape' based on the given width and height. The main method first inputs width and height from the user and then calls the printRectangle method with the width and height.
* A rectangle should be printed with the letter 'x' as shown in the example output.

**#MethodsFactorial**Create a program called MethodsFactorial that has a method called factorial that accepts an integer as its input parameter and returns the factorial of the integer. See the previous "Factorial" exercise for more details. The factorial method should not print anything.
The main method should print factorials of 1...9 as shown in the example output. To determine the factorial of each number, the main method should call the factorial method. Use a loop in the main method.

**#MethodsLibrary**Create a class called MethodsLibrary for storing generic methods. That is, the MethodsLibrary class is a method library class and it does not have the main method. Copy your already existing code of the factorial method to the MethodsLibrary class and do the minor modification to make the method accessible from outside of the MethodsLibrary class.
Create a program called MethodsUseLibraryClass that uses the method factorial of the MethodsLibrary class. The main method inputs an integer from the user and calls the factorial method of the MethodsLibrary class to get the factorial of the integer. Finally, the main method prints the result.

 **#MethodsPrimes**Create a program called MethodsPrimes that has a method called isPrime that takes an integer as  parameter and returns true if the integer is a prime. Otherwise, the method returns false. The method isPrime should not input anything from the user or print anything.
